**Smart UPI Money Collection & Payment Tracking System**

A modern web application that simplifies group payment collection and provides real-time payment status tracking with UPI integration.

## üéØ The Problem I Solved

As someone who frequently organizes group events, I faced a recurring challenge: **tracking who has paid and who hasn't** when collecting money from multiple people. Traditional methods like maintaining spreadsheets or asking everyone individually were time-consuming and error-prone.

The main pain points I identified were:
- **No visibility** into payment status across the group
- **Manual tracking** leading to confusion and missed payments  
- **Lack of verification system** for claimed payments
- **Poor user experience** for both collectors and payers
- **No centralized platform** to manage multiple collection events

## üí° My Solution

I built **Collecto** - a comprehensive payment collection platform that addresses these challenges through:

### üîê **Secure Collector Authentication**
- JWT-based authentication system
- Protected collector dashboards
- Session management with secure cookies

### üìä **Real-time Payment Tracking**
- **Three-state system**: Not Paid ‚Üí Pending Verification ‚Üí Paid
- Visual progress indicators and completion percentages
- Time-based analytics showing payment patterns

### üé® **Modern, Responsive UI**
- Mobile-first design supporting screens as small as 280px
- Gradient backgrounds and card-based layouts
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Consistent design system across all components

### üí≥ **UPI Integration**
- Dynamic QR code generation for each payment
- Deep-link support for all major UPI apps
- Optimized for GPay, PhonePe, Paytm, and others
- Custom transaction notes for better tracking

### ‚úÖ **Smart Verification System**
- Two-step verification process (claim ‚Üí approve)
- Collector dashboard for payment management
- Bulk verification capabilities
- Fraud prevention through manual approval
